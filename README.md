# Deep-Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that can automatically learn and improve functions by examining algorithms. The algorithms use artificial neural networks to learn and improve their function by imitating how humans think and learn.

Deep learning plays an important role in statistics and predictive modeling. By collecting massive amounts of data and analyzing it, Deep Learning creates multiple predictive models to understand patterns and trends within the data.

So basically, deep learning is implemented by the help of deep networks, which are nothing but neural networks with multiple hidden layers.

### Types of Deep Learning Networks

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN):
CNN are a special kind of neural network mainly used primarily in computer vision and image classification applications, can detect features and patterns within an image, enabling tasks, like object detection or recognition. In 2015, a CNN bested a human in an object recognition challenge for the first time.

### 2. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN):
RNN are typically used in natural language and speech recognition applications as it leverages sequential or times series data.
